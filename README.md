# Sunrise 2018

* Built for Node Boron LTS
* `yarn install` to make sure stuff is up to date

## Development

* Within the project root, run `yarn run dev`,
* View site at http://localhost:4444
* Stuff should auto reload when you make a change, etc.

The website is using a simple static website generator. You can create pages in simple HTML or Markdown with simple handlebars-like partial import capability.

## Deployment

* Push to the GitLab repo and it will build and deploy.

**Note:** (Can replace `yarn` with `npm`, but won't benefit from `yarn.lock`, so should be consistent.)
