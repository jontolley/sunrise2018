# Details and Answers

“Called to Serve” the 2018 LDS Aaronic Priesthood Encampment is fast approaching. Below is a snapshot of information. Periodic information from the encampment committee will be provided to keep stakes and individuals up to date as they prepare for the encampment. 
(*Changes may occur in the information below as planning for the Encampment unfolds*)

Glen Squires, Encampment General Chairman, has been meeting for months setting up committees and working with the BSA making preparations for this great event. Each stake has accepted to oversee one or more of the many committees for the encampment, chaired by a member of the respective stakes who serves on the Planning Committee. Young men from each stake are also serving on the planning committee. All of these people are actively engaged in preparing the encampment to be a once in a lifetime event for each participant.

### Who should attend? 

All young men of Aaronic Priesthood age (Deacons, Teachers, Priests), including less active members. 

In addition to members, ward young men’s presidencies and bishoprics are encouraged to identify nonmembers to attend. Please work with your ward mission and your young men to identify such individuals.

Entire Stake Presidencies, Bishoprics, and Stake and Ward Young Men Presidencies should attend, as well as Quorum Advisors and Leaders. 

Each young man that attends will have interaction with visiting general authorities, their Stake Presidents and Bishops on a small group basis during the week. 

### 11 yr old Scouts

The 11 yr. old scouts, and their fathers, where feasible, are invited to attend Friday and Saturday. They will have no cost. 

### Theme 

“Called to Serve” based on D&C Section 4. **Each young man and leader (including Stake Presidents) will be challenged to memorize this inspiring passage of scripture prior to the Encampment.** Begin now. What a thrill it will be to stand together and recite these inspiring verses!  The Encampment will provide numerous opportunities for fun, personal growth and service. 

### Location

The Encampment will take place at BSA Camps Sunrise and Cowles near Newport, WA and just north of Spokane, WA.

### Dates 

Monday Aug. 6th thru Saturday Aug. 11th 2018. The Encampment will begin at noon on Monday and conclude after breakfast on Saturday. 


### Basic Schedule 

Campsites will be by Stake with all campsites located at Camp Sunrise.  

Mon. & Fri. – Camp wide firesides will be held.

Tues., Wed., Thur. evenings-Stake firesides will be under direction of each Stake President.

There will be time for stake/ward study time in the mornings. Field activities, merit badges and special events will be available throughout each day. 

There will be a Stake President’s meeting each morning at 6:30 am to discuss any issues. 

### Campsites 

A map of campsites is under development. At this point, campsites will be similar to the 2012 layout for those stakes attending in 2018. A couple of new stakes have been created and additional stakes from Montana will fill up the camp areas.  

### Activities 

Patterned after a National Jamboree, there will be a myriad of activities suited for a group of nearly 2,000 young men, such as group and individual events, COPE (Challenging Outdoor Personal Experience) courses, shooting sports, obstacle courses, survival opportunities, a merit badge midway, triathlon, and of course, water activities. There will be no water merit badges. We are open to activities to capture young men’s imaginations that a Stake may have men with specialties to conduct. Consider incorporating some of the activities listed in the Young Men 14-18 Activites (https://www.lds.org/youth/ymactivities).
 
**Each stake is to provide 2 merit badges and 3 activities (one spiritually oriented) and the necessary manpower to oversee the activities and merit badges.** 

*The Chairman of the Field Activities, Kevin Folsom, will be contacting each stake young men’s president regarding activity selection. Stakes will need to provide all equipment and personnel required for activities.*

*The Chairman of the Merit Badge Midway, Spencer Sessions, will be contacting each stake young men’s president regarding merit badge selection. Stakes will need to provide awnings/tables/equipment/materials needed for their merit badges.*

We are partnering with BSA who will provide some staff for shooting sports, waterfront, COPE courses, etc. Still, there are opportunities for stake members to participate as staff. We are particularly reaching out to the stakes for help with shooting sports. If individuals need to be trained prior to the Encampment, BSA will provide information to us on the training required for various positions to ensure all are trained. If you have trained people in shooting sports or people that want to be trained, please let us know via email: info@sunrise2018.org. 

### Swim Test

Each youth will have to pass the swim test to participate in water activities. This will need to occur and be certified _prior_ to arrival at the encampment.  More information regarding swim test requirements will be available within scout registration.

### Passport

Each participant will receive a “passport” which will be stamped with a unique stamp at each activity. This will keep track of the activities that a person has participated in. There will not be a specific schedule of these activities. Each person will be allowed to participate in whichever activities they choose. _However, during registration, youth will identify desired targeted activities and merit badges._ If someone wants to participate in a specific activity more than once, they may do so, but will have to wait until those who have not yet participated have a had a turn. 

### Spiritual 

There will be time set aside for each Stake President to meet with the young men of their stake for a _Mountain Top Experience_ in a spiritual setting for inspiration and instruction. There will be opportunities to Learn, to Act and to Share, in the inspired priesthood pattern of learning and doing our Duty to God and Fellowmen. Upon completing a daily assigned spiritual component, an award will be provided to each participant at the end of camp. There will also be opportunity for Bishops to spend time with their young men in morning/evening scripture/instruction and listening time. Following dinner and flags, camp time will be under the direction of the Stake President, who may choose to gather as a stake or individual wards. We hope every Bishop and Stake President will not miss this opportunity to spend crucial time with their young men. Elder Stapleton will attend. We are planning for a member of the General Young Men’s Presidency to participate.

### Service

**Prior to Encampment:** Stake Service Coordinators have been called. They are in charge of coordinating with one of the local BSA scout camps closest to the stake, to provide service at the camp between now and the Encampment. Young men are encouraged to lead or assist in planning and carrying out the service projects as much as possible. These can be one time service projects or multiple events, by stake or by ward. 

**During the Encampment:** Plans are underway for Priests to provide service in surrounding communities. These will be in addition to Learn, Act, Share activities at camp. 

### Registration 

Registration will be online and will start February 1, 2018. The Stake Young Men’s President will oversee registration for the stake. He will be responsible to register all stake personnel attending. He will also ensure that Ward Young Men’s Presidents complete registration on the ward level. Registration will include name, age, emergency contact information, any important medical or dietary information as well as merit badge interests, various activity choices and t-shirt size. This will help assist in scheduling the waterfront, COPE courses or anything with age requirements. Registration will be crucial to assist in organizing the proper number of adults that Stakes will need for merit badges, field events and other activities.      

### Medical

* A medical station will be set up with 24 hr. availability. Each stake is required to identify a physician who will oversee the collection of BSA medical forms for all youth and adult attendees from the stake and review each for accuracy.  The medical forms will be required, by stake, to be hand delivered upon arrival and check in at the encampment. 
* Each stake should have at least one medical personnel for their stake at the encampment. This person will also take a shift at the medical tent during the week.  

### Outreach 

A promotional video is under development with completion expected within a few weeks. It will be distributed to each Stake Presidency to disseminate to the wards. We will count on Stake Presidencies and Young Men leaders to be champions for the event and encourage all young men to attend. The video will also be placed on the forthcoming encampment website. 

### Gateways

A gateway competition will be held during the encampment. It is suggested that each stake build an animated, decorative, and creative gateway to its campsite. Ideas include stake name, something about themselves (stake goals, or anything that would describe the stake). We will add to the website pictures of gateways from past jamborees to give some ideas. Please include the young men in the gateway activity. The planning committee will communicate through the Stake YM President regarding gateways. 

### T-Shirts

The Encampment will provide a t-shirt for every participant. During registration, sizes will be identified. Please note that there will be a cut-off date prior to the encampment to ensure the t-shirts are available for the event.  

### Transportation/Parking

Parking is available across the road from the campsite at Camp Sunrise (unlike 2012 when vehicles were required to park on the highway). There will also be parking at Camp Cowles.  Because Camp Sunrise and Camp Cowles are separated by a short distance, buses will run between the two camps daily. A bus schedule will be included in the passport. No vehicles will be in the Sunrise campsite itself. 

### Security

Each stake will be responsible to fill three slots for each 8 hour shift assigned for camp security. It is the responsibility of the Stake Young Men’s President to ensure the stake has security personnel identified and present. These assignments must be filled by June 1, 2018. If you have additional volunteers willing to work in security, please send an email to info@sunrise2018.org. 

### Trailers 

One camp trailer per stake will be allowed in the stake campsite. It is to be used for central cooking for the stake and not for sleeping or keeping gear out of the elements. The trailer station must be located in the back half of the stake campsite. The only purpose for the trailers is to offer assistance with cooking needs. Campers, trailers, and motorhomes are not permitted in the campsites. If you have any questions, regarding your stake’s trailer, please feel free to email us at info@sunrise2018.org or contact us using the web site contact form. 

### Power/Water/Porta Potties/Showers

There is power at Camp Sunrise, but no power will be available at individual stake campsites. (no generators in campsites). The water system has been buried with risers periodically through the camp. Porta-potties will be available and pumped twice daily. Showers are all located at Camp Cowles. There will be showers designated for adults and young men. A map for showers will be included in the Passport.

### Communication 

Capacity of the cellular system is limited relative to the number of people that will be at the encampment, but service is available. A phone number will be set up that will reach key members of the encampment staff during the week of camp. This number will be provided at a later date. Camp staff will have communication radios.  

There will also be an amateur station activity in the Camp Cowles area operating during the week.

### Training

We plan to include Aaronic Priesthood/BSA leadership training opportunities for adults, and youth. More details will follow.

### Youth Protection Training

**Youth protection training is required for all adults attending the encampment.** Bishops, please have your leaders complete this online training at the BSA website www.scouting.org. The highest priority should be given to the protection of our scouts. 

### Food 

Food will be provided on a camp-wide basis and is included in the cost per person. Basic structure is that stakes will pick up food from a central distribution point and take to the stake campsite for necessary heating/cooking. Stakes will eat at their respective campsites. Each stake will need to have an assigned Head Cook, along with several adult assistants for food preparation and distribution. Each stake will need to provide their own cooking equipment.  A personnel needs and food equipment list will be provided to each stake.  

### Budget

Cost is $210 for each person attending the encampment. This includes those men who will be running merit badges and field events. If a man does not stay for the entire week and someone replaces him, the two men count as one for the entire week. The payment for all persons will be left up to each Bishop to determine the correct amount to pay, on the honor system.  

The $210 fee is the registration fee for the encampment, which includes food, and a t-shirt. Stakes may specify a different fee for wards based on how expenses for the encampment are handled within each stake.

Stakes are responsible to provide the Encampment the $210 per person with payments coming from the stake level (Stake Clerk). The Stake decides the portion that they will provide and the portion that each ward and individual will be responsible to provide. 

The schedule for payments will be due as follows: 

* 30% by November 1, 2017
* 40% due by April 1, 2018
* 30% due by Jul 20, 2018 

This will  ensure all costs can be covered as Encampment planning and execution unfolds. Of the $2,000 already paid by each stake, $1,000 will be applied to the November 1st payment and $1,000 will be applied to the April 1st payment. Payments will be made to: “Spokane Washington North Stake.” 

Stakes should consider how many youth and adults from the stake will participate in order to give you an estimate for Stake costs. 



### Current Needs

* Men trained and certified in rock climbing are needed. If there are individuals in the stake and wards that are trained in rock climbing and would be available to help during the week of the encampment, please email Wayne Brower at wbrower44@hotmail.com.  Please provide information about the applicant to help us make a safe decision. 
* Men trained (certified) or willing to be trained/certified in shooting sports (rifle, pistol, black powder, shotgun). Please send names and qualifications to: info@sunrise2018.org
