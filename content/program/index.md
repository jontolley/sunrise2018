## Program

There will be two camp-wide firesides held during the encampment, one on Monday evening and one on Friday evening. Each stake should hold a fireside on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday evenings under the direction of the stake president.

The Cowles 2012 committee is continuing to develop the camp-wide program for the encampment. If you have suggestions or are interested in participating on the committee, [contact us](/contact/).
