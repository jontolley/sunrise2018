## Activities

The activity program for the encampment follows the pattern of a national or world jamboree. There will be dozens of activity areas that provided for the young men. These include traditional summer camp activities such as swimming, archery, and rifle shooting, along with activities such as obstacle courses and paintball archery.

There will also be a merit badge midway where boys can work on nearly thirty or forty different merit badges. Because the activity program is so much larger than a traditional summer camp, most boys may not complete as many merit badges as they would at a traditional camp.  Leaders will need to work closely with their young men to make sure they accomplish what they need to at the encampment while taking part in the wide range of activities.

Activity and merit badge areas will be open from 2:00pm until 5:00pm on Monday, August 6th. These areas will be open from 9:00am to 12:00pm and 1:30pm to 5:00pm on Tuesday through Friday. This provides a total of 29 hours for boys to participate in the activities and merit badge programs.

Each participating stake will develop and staff three activity areas and two merit badge areas during the encampment. The encampment staff is working with stake leaders to coordinate the list of activities and merit badges to be offered at the encampment. These details will be posted on the web site as they are finalized.

If you have questions about your stake’s activities and merit badges or would like to participate in developing these activities, contact your Stake Young Men’s President and offer to assist. We do not need any additional staff at the encampment level to manage these activities, but each stake is going to need a large number of volunteers to staff these areas.

## Called to Swim, Bike, and Run Triathlon

The Called to Swim Bike and Run Triathlon will be held on Thursday, August 9, beginning at 9:30am. Participants should meet in the Camp Cowles swim area for the race briefing at 9:10am.  The transition area will open at 8:00am for body marking.  Athletes can retrieve their bikes from Finch Lodge and set up their transition areas at that time.

The triathlon will be chip timed by a professional timing service.  There will be two age classes: 14–15 and 16–18. Adults may participate (and will be chip-timed) with youth in either age group, but prizes will be awarded for the first three places to the youth finishers in each age group only. The goal is to have some competition and fun; the chip timing will allow for accurate times, paces, rankings and bragging rights for each segment of the race.  Results will be posted online.

Bike check-in occurs at camp registration. The bicycles will be kept in Finch Lodge until race day; racers may retrieve their bikes from the lodge beginning at 8am on race day.

All participants must have completed a BSA swim check before camp.

**Swim: 500 yards.**  Bring your own goggles.  No swim fins, hand paddles or flotation devices.  Boats will be positioned along the swim route for aid if needed.  You may hold onto a boat for support, but they will not help you make forward progress.

**Bike: 10 miles.**  Bring your own bike, helmet (no helmet means immediate disqualification) bike clothing and water bottle.  The bike course is unsupported (no aid stations) but there will be volunteers at intersections to help you stay on course.  The course is open to traffic so obey all traffic laws (except speed limits) and keep your eyes open.  You must wear a shirt while on the bike and during the run. For your safety there will be no music, headphones, earbuds, etc while on the bike or run.

**Run: 3.1 miles.**  Dirt roads and trails in and around Camp Cowles.  Bring running shoes (if using cycling shoes for the bike). There will be an aid station with water at the mid-point of the run.

**Tips:**

1. Do not expect to perform well if you do not spend some time training before the race.  There are many training programs available for free online.  This one will give you a great place to start:   http://beginnertriathlete.com/discussion/training/trainingplans-list.asp
2. Race attire.  Most triathletes wear special triathlon shorts (imagine lycra bike shorts with a thinner chamois (that pad in the seat) that they wear for the entire race.  You can purchase them if you chose, but for this "sprint" distance tri, swimming in a pair of bike shorts will be just as effective as tri shorts and will save your time in transition from swim to bike (T1) and from bike to run (T2).
3. Food. Eat a light breakfast that morning.  Most athletes will eat a meal about 2-3 hours prior to the race, allowing time for some digestion but not starting the race feeling hungry.
4. Pacing.  While this is a "sprint" distance triathlon, you will need to pace yourself. This is where training comes in.  As you train for the event you will get a feel for what level of exertion you can sustain for the entire event.
5. Swim tips. Unless you are a competitive swimmer start out slower that you think you need to and then speed up as you get into a rhythm. If you feel yourself start to panic, swim to one side of the course and raise your hand for an aid boat.  Remember your swimming and lifesaving merit badge training and you'll be just fine.

## Merit Badges

The merit badge midway provides an area where boys can choose from literally dozens of merit badges during the scheduled activity times. Each stake will be responsible to develop and staff two  areas in the merit badge midway. This is a list of merit badge options likely to be offered. **We will soon be commencing working with stakes to develop the _actual_ list of merit badges.**
