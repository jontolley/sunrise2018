## Field Activities

The encampment will have activities for all ages of youth, including some activities designed specifically for different age groups. Some activities test athletic skills, some provide problem-solving challenges, and some are just a lot of fun. There will also be activities that will help strengthen testimonies, sharpen team-building skills, and activities to help youth answer questions about the gospel asked by friends and those they meet.

Activity areas will be open from 2:00pm until 5:00pm on Monday, July 30. These areas will be open from 9:00am to 12:00pm and 2:00pm to 5:00pm on Tuesday through Friday. Some areas will remain open through the lunch break.

Each participant will receive a “passport,” which will be stamped with a unique stamp at each activity. This will keep track of the activities that a person has participated in. There will not be a specific schedule for these activities; each person will be allowed to participate in whichever activities they choose. If someone wants to participate in a specific activity more than once, they may do so but will have to wait until those who have not yet participated have had a turn.

Here is a list of the activities that have been planned so far, with more to come:
