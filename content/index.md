## About the Encampment

The Inland Northwest has a rich history of Boy Scout encampments. Nearly 35,000 scouts gathered at Farragut State Park, north of Coeur d’Alene, Idaho, for the 1969 national jamboree. Farragut later hosted 11,000 LDS scouts and leaders in 1984 for what was then the largest LDS scout encampment in the history of the Church. In 2012, over 3,000 attended the Catch the Vision LDS encampment, and in 2015, 2,700 attended the Columbia River encampment.

Following in this tradition, all eyes turn in 2018 to the Cowles/Sunrise Scout Reservation, located twenty minutes west of Newport, Washington. From August 6 to August 11, 2018, nearly 3,000 boys and leaders from 16 stakes in Washington, Idaho and Montana will participate in the 2018 LDS Aaronic Priesthood Encampment.

The theme of the 2018 LDS scout encampment is “Called to Serve.” Our vision is one of a week of camping where young men have fun in the outdoors and stretch themselves physically, mentally and spiritually. We hope they will recognize their call to serve and commit to do so with all their heart, might, mind, and strength, being inspired to make choices consistent with their divine potential.

We invite you to join us in the forests of eastern Washington in 2018. We are planning a full week of scout activities; camp-wide, stake- and ward-level programs; and individual experiences.  We hope your young men will join us for this once-in-a-lifetime event.

## Message from the Camp General Chairman

        <p>
            Welcome to “Called to Serve” the 2018 LDS Aaronic Priesthood Encampment. It is a great honor to extend to each young man and leader an invitation to attend. I invite you to participate with all your heart, might, mind and strength.
        </p>
        <p>
            Monday August 6th thru Saturday Aug 11th 2018 are the Encampment dates. There will be numerous opportunities for fun, personal growth and service. Patterned after a National Jamboree, there will be a myriad of activities such as group and individual events, COPE courses, shooting sports, obstacle courses, and survival opportunities. There will be a merit badge midway, triathlon, and of course, water activities. This will be an opportunity to invite and include your friends.
        </p>
        <p>
            Each of us has been “Called to Serve”. Whether in our families, quorums, communities, country, or across the globe, service to our fellow men is truly service to our God. The foundation for the Encampment will be the Lord’s direction to us through the Prophet Joseph Smith. In Doctrine &amp; Covenants Section 4 we learn the pattern for preparation and joy of service. Each young man and leader will be challenged to memorize this inspiring passage of scripture prior to the Encampment.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Encampment will be held at Camp Sunrise near Diamond Lake in E. Washington on over 100 acres of land owned by the Boy Scouts of America. There will be opportunities for Priesthood Leaders to implement the three principles highlighted by the Young Men General Presidency: <em>to be with them, connect them with heaven, and let them lead.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            There will be two large camp-wide firesides and three stake or ward camp firesides. Young men will be able to rub shoulders with and learn from their Stake Presidents, Bishops, and other leaders of the Church who will be attending.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our desire is that each young man will:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Have fun, make new friends and enjoy the outdoors.</li>
            <li>Experience the excitement of personal challenge.</li>
            <li>Discover the joy, satisfaction and good feeling that comes from serving others.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            We welcome all. Come and have a once in a lifetime experience for young men and leaders.
        </p>
        <p>
            Sincerely,<br />
            Glen W. Squires<br />
            General Chairman<br />
            2018 LDS Encampment
